AC Rally Pacenote Pal
=====================

Pacenote Pal is an application for Assetto Corsa Rally that replaces the in-game codriver with an external one.
This way you can use custom voices, edit the pacenotes per stage, and change the timing.

A demo can be found here: https://youtu.be/Quq5dFNgtvQ

**This software is nowhere near finished** and has many rough edges.

How it works
------------

1. Start the program.
2. Select your stage. These are the names the game uses internally, and they may not correspond to the names in the game.
3. Press start 
4. Set the audio for the in-game spotter to 0%
5. Drive to the start of the stage. As the countdown starts, press the space bar. You will hear a beep.

Changing the voice can be done by replacing the files in the folder `voices`. Changing the pacenotes can be done by 
editing the JSON files in the pacenotes folder.
